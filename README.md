This is an  <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm">CosmWasm!</a> smartcontract implementing a p2p delivery logic. <br>
With this contract you can create delivery request worth an amount of tokens based on cw20 for cosmos blockchain users.
</p>

## Design and features
* The contract works on the principle of mutual pledge.
* Verification is based on the signature of the secret key secp256k1, which the sender gives to the recipient who receives the package in exchange for a coupon.
* None of the parties can withdraw the pledge before the performance of the contract, or the expiration of obligations on statuses.
